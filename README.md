# iptables configurations

This is a project to figure out how to use iptables to configure firewalls for 

+ a dedicated firewall
+ workstations behind the firewall
+ maybe some other configurations

Files here include versions of:
 + the iptables.sh script that loads modules, flushes current rules, and sets new policies and rules.
 + ipt.save files that are generated by `iptables-save > ipt.save` after rules are loaded.
 + ipt.save files can be loaded with `iptables-restore < ipt.save` without going through iptables.sh again.
